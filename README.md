## üß© What are Naptha Modules

Naptha Modules are the building blocks of multi-agent applications, which enable them to run across multiple nodes. There are currently five types of Modules:

- **Agent Modules:** Things like Chat Agents, Task-solving Agents, ReAct Agents, etc.
- **Tool Modules:** Things like Web Search, Python Code Execution, etc.
- **Agent Orchestrator Modules:** Things like Organizations of Coding Agents, Social Simulations, etc.
- **Environment Modules:** Things like Group Chats (like WhatsApp for Agents), Information Board (Reddit for Agents), Auctions (eBay for Agents), etc.
- **Knowledge Base Modules:** Things like Wikipedia, GitHub, etc.
- **Memory Modules:** Things like Chat History, Task History, etc.
- **Persona Modules:** Things like Social Personas generated from exported Twitter data, or synthetically-generated Market Personas

Modules are stored on GitHub, HuggingFace, IPFS, or DockerHub with the URL registered on the Naptha Hub. If you're familiar with Kubeflow Pipelines, Modules are a bit like Components. Modules are based on Poetry Python packages, with some additions like schemas, configs, and an entrypoint. A typical Module has the following structure:

```
- my_module/
  - my_module/
    - __init__.py
    - configs/
      - deployment.json
      - environment_deployments.json
      - llm_configs.json
    - run.py
    - schemas.py
  - tests/
    - __init__.py
  - pyproject.toml
  - poetry.lock
  - README.md
  - LICENSE
  - .env
  - .gitignore
  - Dockerfile
```

You can run Modules locally, or deploy to a Naptha Node using `naptha run` commands from the [Naptha SDK](https://github.com/NapthaAI/naptha-sdk). Modules are executed within Poetry virtual environments or Docker containers on Naptha Nodes.

## üèó Creating a new Naptha Module

### üõ† Prerequisites 

#### Install Poetry 

From the official poetry [docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer):

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
export PATH="/home/$(whoami)/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### üîß Making Changes to the Module

Before deploying a new or updated module to a Naptha node, you should iterate on improvements with the module locally. 

### Clone and Install the Module

Clone the repo using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NapthaAI/<module_name>
cd <module_name>
```

Create a copy of the .env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

If your module calls others modules (e.g. using Agent(), Tool(), or Environment()), you need to set a ```PRIVATE_KEY``` in the .env file (e.g. this can be the same as the ```PRIVATE_KEY``` you use with the Naptha SDK). If using OpenAI, make sure to set the ```OPENAI_API_KEY``` environment variable.

You can install the module using:

```bash
poetry install
```

#### Making Changes to the Code

The main place to make changes to the code is in the ```run.py``` file. This is the default entry point that will be used when the module run is initiated. The run function can instantiate a class (e.g. an agent class) or call a function. 

#### Making Changes to the Configs

You can make changes to the configs in the ```configs``` folder. The ```deployment.json``` file is the main config file for the module. You may also have other config files for subdeployments (e.g. ```tool_deployments.json```, ```environment_deployments.json```, ```kb_deployments.json```, ```memory_deployments.json```). For example:

**MODEL**: If you would like to use a different model, you can change the ```llm_config['config_name']``` in the ```deployment.json``` file (the ```config_name``` must match the ```config_name``` in the ```llm_configs.json``` file). If using OpenAI, make sure to set the ```OPENAI_API_KEY``` environment variable.

**PERSONA**: If you would like to use a different persona, you can add ```persona_module['module_url']``` in the config dict of ```deployments.json``` file (the ```module_url``` must point to a valid Hugging Face dataset). See the [simple_chat_agent](https://github.com/NapthaAI/simple_chat_agent) module for an example of how to use a persona module with an agent.

**TOOLS**: If you would like your module to use a tool, you can add ```tool_deployments: {'name': '<tool_deployment_name>'}``` in the deployment dict of ```deployments.json``` file (the ```tool_deployment_name``` must match the ```name``` field in the ```tool_deployments.json``` file). See the [generate_image_agent](https://github.com/NapthaAI/generate_image_agent/tree/main) module for an example of how to use a tool as a subdeployment.

**ENVIRONMENT**: If you would like your module to use an environment, you can add ```environment_deployments: {'name': '<environment_deployment_name>'}``` in the deployment dict of ```deployments.json``` file (the ```environment_deployment_name``` must match the ```name``` field in the ```environment_deployments.json``` file). See the [multiagent_chat](https://github.com/NapthaAI/multiagent_chat) module for an example of how to use an environment as a subdeployment.

**KB**: If you would like your module to use a knowledge base, you can add ```kb_deployments: {'name': '<kb_deployment_name>'}``` in the deployment dict of ```deployments.json``` file (the ```kb_deployment_name``` must match the ```name``` field in the ```kb_deployments.json``` file). See the [wikipedia_agent](https://github.com/NapthaAI/wikipedia_agent/tree/main) module for an example of how to use a knowledge base as a subdeployment.

**MEMORY**: If you would like your module to use memory, you can add ```memory_deployments: {'name': '<memory_deployment_name>'}``` in the deployment dict of ```deployments.json``` file (the ```memory_deployment_name``` must match the ```name``` field in the ```memory_deployments.json``` file).

## üß™ Testing the Module

After making changes to the module, testing usually involves the following steps:

1. Test the module locally without the Naptha Node
2. Test the module on a local Naptha Node (with a local Hub)
3. Test the module on a hosted Naptha Node (with the hosted Naptha Hub)

### üñ•Ô∏è Test the Module Locally without Node

You can run the module using:

```bash
poetry run python <module_name>/run.py
```

Now you can iterate on the module and commit your changes.

### üåê Test the Module on a Local Node (with a Local Hub)

For this step, you will need to:

1. Run your own Naptha Node and Hub. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/NapthaAI/node) (still private, please reach out if you'd like access) to run your own Naptha Node and Hub. To run a local Hub, set ```LOCAL_HUB=True``` in the .env file for the NapthaAI/node repository.
2. Install the Naptha SDK using the [instructions here](https://github.com/NapthaAI/naptha-sdk). To use the SDK with your local node and hub, set ```NODE_URL=http://localhost:7001``` and ```HUB_URL=ws://localhost:3001/rpc``` in the .env file for the NapthaAI/naptha-sdk repository.


#### Running the Module on a local Naptha Node

First, you can push the module to your GitHub or IPFS (or both). If using GitHub, make sure to change the remote origin. Also add a new module version number using e.g.:

```bash
git tag v0.1
```

To store on GitHub, you can use:

```bash
git push --tags
```

Before registering on the Naptha Hub, make sure the module field in your deployment.json file has a ```name```, ```description```, ```parameters```, ```module_type```, ```module_version```, ```module_entrypoint```, and ```execution_type``` fields:

 ```
 [
    {
      ...
        "module": {
            "name": "module_template",
            "description": "Module Template",
            "parameters": "{tool_name: str, tool_input_data: str}",
            "module_type": "agent",
            "module_version": "v0.1",
            "module_entrypoint": "run.py",
            "execution_type": "package"
        },
      ...
    }
 ]
 ```

You can register the module from a GitHub url by adding your specific repo url with the ```-r``` flag:

```bash
naptha publish -r https://github.com/NapthaAI/module_template
```

Alternatively, you can store the module on IPFS and register on the Naptha Hub by running:

```bash
naptha publish -r
```

If successful, you will an output with the IPFS hash, and a link where you can test download via the browser http://provider.akash.pro:30584/ipfs/<ipfs_hash>.

If you would also like to publish subdeployments, you can use:

```bash
naptha publish -r -s
```

Make sure to add a list of dicts with a ```name``` field to one or more of the ```agent_deployments```, ```tool_deployments```, ```environment_deployments```, ```kb_deployments```, or ```memory_deployments``` fields in your deployment.json file:

 ```
 [
    {
      ...
        "agent_deployments": [{"name": "agent_deployment_1"}],
        "tool_deployments": [{"name": "tool_deployment_1"}],
        "environment_deployments": [{"name": "environment_deployment_1"}],
        "kb_deployments": [{"name": "kb_deployment_1"}],
        "memory_deployments": [{"name": "memory_deployment_1"}],
      ...
    }
 ]
 ```

And also add corresponding ```agent_deployments.json```, ```tool_deployments.json```, ```environment_deployments.json```, ```kb_deployments.json```, or ```memory_deployments.json``` files to the ```configs``` folder for each subdeployment. In each file, there should be a module field with a ```name```, ```description```, ```parameters```, ```module_type```, ```module_version```, ```module_entrypoint```, and ```execution_type``` fields:

 ```
 [
    {
      ...
        "module": {
            "name": "subdeployment_module",
            "description": "Subdeployment Module",
            "parameters": "{tool_name: str, tool_input_data: str}",
            "module_type": "tool",
            "module_version": "v0.1",
            "module_entrypoint": "run.py",
            "execution_type": "package"
        },
      ...
    }
 ]
 ```

You can confirm that the modules were registered on the Hub by running:

```bash
naptha agents
```

Or the equivalent command for the module type you are using (e.g. ```naptha tools```, ```naptha orchestrators```, ```naptha environments```, ```naptha kbs```, ```naptha memories```, ```naptha personas```).

Once the module is published, you can run it on a local Naptha Node using the Naptha SDK:

```bash
naptha run agent:module_template -p "func_name='func', func_input_data='gm...'" 
```

For troubleshooting, see the Troubleshooting section in NapthaAI/node for checking the logs.
